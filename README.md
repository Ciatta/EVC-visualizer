# EVC-visualizer
Tool to visualize how the guards of an eternal vertex cover move when an edge is attacked over grid graphs, in particular hexagonal, triangular, octagonal and squared grids.
</br>
What is an <b>Eternal Vertex Cover</b>? </br>
An eternal vertex cover is a set of vertices in a graph such that,
as edges are attacked over time, it is always possible to move
guards within the graph in response to these attacks such that
every edge is covered by at least one guard at all times.
</br>
The movements strategies are based on (Eternal) Vertex Cover Number of Infinite and Finite Grid Graphs [source] (
